# 🌐 The Nexus Marketplace

**The Nexus Marketplace** is a work-in-progress project for a college course, where we're exploring the idea of creating an online marketplace.  
The general concept is to build a platform where users can **buy, sell, or trade** digital goods, physical products, or services — but the exact scope is still being decided.

Right now, this repository is primarily for **planning, experimenting, and learning**. Expect frequent changes as the project evolves.
