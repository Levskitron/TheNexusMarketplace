# The Nexus Marketplace

**The Nexus Marketplace** is a work-in-progress project for HND Software Development, where we're exploring the idea of creating an online marketplace.  
The general concept is to build a platform where users can **buy, sell, or trade** digital goods, physical products, or services — but the exact scope is still being decided.

Right now, this repository is primarily for **planning, experimenting, and learning**. Expect frequent changes as the project evolves.

## Project Overview

At this stage, the project is still in **early development**.  
Some initial ideas we're considering for the marketplace include:

- Gaming peripherals and PC parts
- Digital game keys or downloadable content
- General marketplace features like user profiles and ratings
- Secure checkout and payment integration
- Search and filtering to find items easily

> Nothing is final yet — features will change as the project develops.
